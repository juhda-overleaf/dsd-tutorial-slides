\begin{frame}{Properties to be Guaranteed}
  
\begin{description}
\item[Safety Property] Nothing bad happens: Can be checked at design time;
\item[Liveness Property] Something good eventually happens: Much
  harder problem;
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item For real-time systems all properties are safety properties, but
  modeling of time has to be included.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Sharing and Isolation}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Full Isolation to accommodate the worst case:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Dedicated resources for a given task;
    \item Addresses real-time and safety requirements;
    \item Costly due to over-provisioning;
    \item Complete isolation = no interference.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Full sharing to accommodate the average case:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Best average performance for given cost;
    \item Lowest cost for target average performance;
    \item Highest efficiency;
    \item Unbounded worst case performance.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Sharing with bounded interference:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Allowing and controlling interference can provide real-time
      and safety requirement;
    \item Reduced costs;
    \item Applicable for mix of critical and best effort tasks.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Interference Effects}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Direct interference and competition for the same resource;
    \item Indirect interference through shared resources:
      
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Performance inversion,
      \item Over-synchronization.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\item<1-> No control or data dependency between C and D branches;
\item<4> \hilightA{If C is delayed or stuck, D suffers.}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Spatial and Temporal Isolation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spatial isolation: No sharing at any time;
  \item Temporal isolation: Sharing at pre-defined time periods.
  \end{itemize}
